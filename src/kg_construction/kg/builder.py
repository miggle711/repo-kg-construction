repo_kg_builder.py

Builds structural Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from Python repository source code.

Given a GitHub repo and a commit SHA, this module:
  1. Clones the repo as a bare git mirror (cached locally)
  2. Extracts the source tree at that commit via git archive
  3. Parses every .py file with Python's ast module in parallel
  4. Emits nodes (file, class, function, method, test_function, import) and
     edges (contains, imports, calls, accesses, inherits, tests, uses,
     overrides, depends_on, module_depends_on) into a JSON KG

Node metadata includes: signatures, type annotations, default values,
decorators, docstrings, raised/caught exceptions, branch counts,
assert patterns (for test functions), class attributes, module constants,
and __all__ exports.

Output format:
    {
        "nodes": [{"id": ..., "type": ..., "label": ..., "metadata": {...}}, ...],
        "edges": [{"source": ..., "target": ..., "relation": ..., "metadata": {...}}, ...],
        "metadata": {"repo": ..., "base_commit": ..., "file_count": ..., "parse_mode": "source", "schema_version": ...}
    }

Usage:
    builder = RepoKGBuilder()
    kg = builder.build("psf/requests", "<commit_sha>")
    builder.save("psf/requests", kg)

Module layout (post-split):
  - ast_helpers.py   pure AST-in/data-out utilities (_get_signature,
                     _build_func_metadata, etc.) Re-exported here for
                     back-compat with code that imports them from
                     repo_kg_builder directly.
  - repo_manager.py  git clone / archive extraction (RepoManager).
  - repo_kg_builder  this module — KGNode/KGEdge data types, _parse_file
                     (per-file AST → nodes+edges), RepoASTParser (parallel
                     driver + second-pass edge resolution), RepoKGBuilder
                     (top-level entry point).
